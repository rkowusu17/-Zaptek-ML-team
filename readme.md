## Notes and Steps:

### Important notice. We need two datasets here.

## X(Independent) and Y (Dependent)

For this project where we will be predicting the number of SMS from the total number of calls.
We need to make use of just two fields :

1. total SMS = Number of SMS received and sent
2. total calls = Number of calls received and sent

## Steps In accessing the data:

1. The provided data is titled "working_dataset.csv" and this can be found in the Regression folder
2. Access or download just the csv file, familiarize yourself with it using excel or pandas.
3. Perform necessary analysis and labeling (training, testing).
4. Based on the shared tutorial videos, perform the necessary analysis and computation using scikitLearn to make your regression model.

## N.B:

There'll be other data fields, like the Internet Activities, Country codes and many more.
To sharpen you data analysis skills, you need to use some pyhton modules to extract the needed fields

Now you go ahead to import some ML models essential for regression, then we are good to go

### All the best !!
